## Goal:

### Learn how to integrate animations with Riverpod.

### Animate widgets based on app state.

### Use StateNotifier / AsyncNotifier or Notifier with animation triggers.

### Why Combine Animations with Riverpod?

### Animations can be:

### Triggered by user input or app state

### Synced with global/shared state (like page transitions, error flags)

### Decoupled from widgets for cleaner architecture

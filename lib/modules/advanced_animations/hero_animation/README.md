## Goal:

### Use Hero animations for smooth shared element transitions between screens.

### Animate a widget (e.g. image, card) from one screen to the next.

## What is a Hero?

### A Hero is a widget that "flies" between two screens during a route transition, creating a visually continuous experience.

### It works by:

### Tagging a widget with a unique tag

### Wrapping it in a Hero() on both screens

## Goal:

### Learn how to chain multiple Tweens together using TweenSequence.

### Create complex, multi-phase animations (like bounce → shrink → fade).

### Why Use TweenSequence?

### TweenSequence lets you:

### Split an animation into multiple parts.

### Control what happens at which time.

### Apply different curves/tweens to each part.

| Concept             | Description                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `TweenSequence`     | Chain multiple tweens in a single animation        |
| `TweenSequenceItem` | Each animation phase with its own tween and weight |
| `weight`            | Relative time distribution for each phase          |

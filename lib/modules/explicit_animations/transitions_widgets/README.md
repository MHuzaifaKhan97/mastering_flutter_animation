## Goal:

### Learn to animate specific properties (opacity, position, scale, size) using Flutterâ€™s built-in transition widgets.

### These are explicit but simplified widgets that work great with an AnimationController.

## FadeTransition : Opacity

## ScaleTransition : Scale

## SlideTransition : Position (Offset)

## SizeTransition : Size

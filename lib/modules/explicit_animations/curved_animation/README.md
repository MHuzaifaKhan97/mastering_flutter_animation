## Goal:

### Learn how to make your animations feel more natural and aesthetic using curves like bounce, ease-in, ease-out, elastic, etc.

### What is CurvedAnimation?

### CurvedAnimation applies a curve (non-linear timing function) to your animation to make it look less robotic and more smooth or springy.

## Common Animation Curved

| Curve                  | Effect                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Curves.linear`        | Constant speed (default)      |
| `Curves.easeIn`        | Starts slow, ends fast        |
| `Curves.easeOut`       | Starts fast, ends slow        |
| `Curves.easeInOut`     | Slow → Fast → Slow            |
| `Curves.bounceOut`     | Bouncy effect                 |
| `Curves.elasticOut`    | Springy, overshoots           |
| `Curves.decelerate`    | Fast → Slow                   |
| `Curves.fastOutSlowIn` | Material Design default curve |

## Goal:

### Animate multiple properties at different time intervals using a single AnimationController.

### This is called staggered animation.

### What's an Interval?

### Interval allows you to specify the start and end portion (0.0 to 1.0) of the animation controller's timeline for a specific animation.

## Use Case:

### Imagine animating:

### Opacity (0% - 30%)

### Size (30% - 60%)

### Rotation (60% - 100%)

### All controlled by one AnimationController.
